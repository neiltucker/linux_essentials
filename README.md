Courseware Access: https://www.softwaretutorialservices.com/course/linux-essentials

this course covers six linux topics or lessons.  Each lesson has its own lab exercise that can be done using your own computer or free resources on the Internet.  You will learn about these resources in lesson 1.  Lesson 2 will show you  how to use the built-in help features to use commands even if you are new to them.​

​Lessons 3 through 6 discuss different compute resources you need to manage.  Creating files and folders and learning to navigate the file system will be discussed before learning about installing and managing applications.  We will then see how to use computer system resources and network tools to manage connectivity.​

It is recommended that you perform the lab exercise associated with a lesson before moving on to a new topic.  If you are already familiar with Linux, you may choose to review all the material and then do the labs together.  If you are reviewing the material with the help of an instructor, he will provide instructions on how to work through the material.​
